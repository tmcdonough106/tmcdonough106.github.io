I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Stony Brook University. I use theory and methods from political psychology and behavioral economics to study how people evaluate the future. 

When I'm not doing research, I like to spend my time studying languages, baking, and playing whatever instruments I can get my hands on. I am also in the process of training for a marathon.
