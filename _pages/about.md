I'm a PhD student at Stony Brook University in the Department of Political Science. I study political behavior in the context of decision making, using methods from political psychology and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in the ability of citizens in democracies to effictively address collective risks. My work focuses on public opinion and political beliefs, with a focus on how priorities, predictions, and beliefs adapt as new information becomes available. I am also interested in the evolving political discourse and policy action around climate change, technological innovation, disease outbreaks, terrorism, population growth, resource distribution, and similar collective risks.

My research agenda hopes to answer the following questions:
1. How do people identify a problem?
2. How is a solution found and agreed upon?
3. When and how is a solution implemented?
4. What happens when an issue is solved?
5. What happens when a forecasted risk comes to fruition?

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of New Hampshire, where I majored in political science and international affairs with minors in philosophy, economics, and American history. All of these disciplines and more inform my work today and help me to explore the complexities of the political decision making.

I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to work as the Director of Communications for [Leading Cities](https://leadingcities.org/about), where I learned the value of science communication for technological integration and the importance of providing public support for social innovation.

When I'm not doing research, I like to spend my time studying languages (currently Portuguese and Japanese), baking, and playing whatever instruments I can get my hands on. I'm also hoping to get into the NY marathon sometime in the near future.
