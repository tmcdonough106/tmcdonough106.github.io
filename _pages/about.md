I'm a PhD student at Stony Brook University in the Department of Political Science. I use political psychology and formal modeling to model how people evaluate the future, process information, and react to social and technological innovation. I am particularly interested in the intersection between anthropogenic activity and the collective social consciousness of its impacts. 

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of New Hampshire, where I learned the foundations of politics, philosophy, economics, and American history. All of these disciplines and more inform my work today and help me to understand the complexities of the political decision making.

I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to work as the Director of Communications for [Leading Cities](https://leadingcities.org/about) during 2020, where I learned the value of science communication for technological adoption and of public support for startup companies.

When I'm not doing research, I like to spend my time studying languages (currently Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish), baking, and playing whatever instruments I can get my hands on.

Thanks for stopping by! Email me if you'd like to collaborate.
