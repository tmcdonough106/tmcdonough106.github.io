I'm a PhD student at Stony Brook University in the Department of Political Science. I use theory and methods from political psychology and behavioral economics to study how people evaluate the future. My goal is to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and public opinion to help prevent global catastrophes.

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of New Hampshire, where I learned the foundations of politics, philosophy, economics, and American history. All of these disciplines and more inform my work today and help me to understand the complexities of the political decision making.

When I'm not doing research, I like to spend my time studying languages (currently Portuguese and Korean), baking, and playing whatever instruments I can get my hands on. I am also in the process of training for a marathon.

Thanks for stopping by! Email me if you'd like to collaborate.
