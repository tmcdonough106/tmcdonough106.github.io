I'm a PhD student at Stony Brook University in the Department of Political Science. I study information processing in the context of political decision making, using methods from political psychology and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in how people evaluate the future based on their perceptions of event probabilites. My current research projects include investigating shifts in public opinion following major policy events and an experimental study measuring the impact of social signaling on public goods games.

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of New Hampshire, where I learned the foundations of politics, philosophy, economics, and American history. All of these disciplines and more inform my work today and help me to understand the complexities of the political decision making.

I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to work as the Director of Communications for [Leading Cities](https://leadingcities.org/about), where I learned the value of science communication for technological adoption and the importance of providing public support for social innovation.

When I'm not doing research, I like to spend my time studying languages (currently Portuguese and Japanese), baking, and playing whatever instruments I can get my hands on.

Thanks for stopping by! Email me if you'd like to collaborate.
